If user pause a running timer and then again resume it, then timer will get resumed from the same value at which it is pause. If user clicks on the stop button, then timer will be set to “00:00:00”.  The timer will be increment or decrement according to the current value of “Increment By”.  The value of “Increment By” can be changed using the stepper provided and can vary from  -10 to 10.
